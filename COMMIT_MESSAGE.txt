feat: refactor code architecture and prepare for production deployment

## 🏗️ Architecture Refactoring

### Player.js → Components
- Created PhysicsComponent (movement, gravity, collisions)
- Created CombatComponent (attacks, damage, hitboxes)
- Created ProjectileComponent (stone throwing system)
- Created AnimationComponent (rendering, animations)

### Game.js → Engine + Systems
- Created GameEngine (core game loop, state management)
- Created RenderSystem (all rendering logic)
- Created PowerUpSystem (power-up spawning & collection)
- Created CombatSystem (combat interactions)

## ✅ Testing
- All 278 tests passing
- No breaking changes to public API
- Components maintain backward compatibility

## 📦 Deployment Ready
- Updated vercel.json configuration
- Updated .vercelignore to exclude tests
- Updated index.html script loading order
- Removed console.log statements
- Validated all configurations

## 📝 Documentation
- Added PRE_DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md
- Added READY_TO_DEPLOY.md
- Updated VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md with new structure
- Created pre-deploy-test.sh automated testing script

## 🎯 Benefits
- Better code organization (separation of concerns)
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Improved testability
- Cleaner architecture
- Production ready
